# Procedural Project
## Done in COP 2001 (Programming methodology) - May 2019 - June 1029

**Program's purpose**
The purpose of the program is track production for a manufacter. The programs allows the user to sign into their own accout and generate products that will be created on a production line. The user is also able to pullback previous products and create more of them. The program also saves all production to a local txt file so that once the program is ran through multiple times the data is still saved.



**The Programming Concepts learned**
- Arrays/Vectors
- Strings
- Structs
- Prototyping
- Saving to txt

**Useful Tools**
- Jon from Cave of Programming [link to that here](https://caveofprogramming.com/)
- Hackerrank
- A big one for me was Reddit. I use it daily and start using it to get help too, on my code.
- Professor Vanselow - anytime I was lost or didnt understand something I texted him ASAP
